# Odin-restraunt-page


In this project I will be creating a restraunt page that will use tabs to go to other web pages on the site to show the menu and contact listing. I use primarily JavaScript to create elements and append them to eachother in the DOM. I also get hands on experience using Webpack to bundle up my code to one output file. This project helped me work on my JavaScript and WebPack skills.
